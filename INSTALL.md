## How to Install

Installation is very simple, it takes three steps to start playing.
First, in your directory where the zip is located, unzip the file.

This can either be done either visually or by running
```sh
unzip poker.zip
```

Second, in that directory, run
```sh
make playable
```

Finally, run 
```sh
./main.byte
```
to start playing.
