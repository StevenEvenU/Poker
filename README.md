# Poker ♠ ♥ ♦ ♣
### Welcome to our poker game!
This is our final project for [CS3110](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2021sp/) at [Cornell University](https://cornell.edu) :herb:

For a refresher of the rules and objective of Texas Hold 'em Poker see [here](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/texas-holdem-poker/), and for even more information there is the [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em)

The main goal of this is two fold.
1. To have a fun game of poker that is playable in the terminal
2. To implement different ways for the computer to play
    * Truely randomly
    * Varying risk levels of life-like play
    * Counting cards
